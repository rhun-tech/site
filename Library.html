            <p>Is it possible to be possessed by possessions? A possession is something that is owned.</p>
            <p>However, the possession owned by the owner can possess the owner.</p>
            <p>This occurs when the owner becomes obsessed with the item, allowing it to dominate their thoughts and
              actions. Consequently, the owner's sense of self can become intertwined with the possession, leading to a
              loss of freedom and autonomy.</p>
            <p>A bird is comforted by its nest, a turtle by its shell, a dragon by its lair. Though a dragon's lair is
              not unadorned, nor are our homes.</p>
            <p>Like a dragon, we seek to hoard, among other things, wealth. To store it. To keep it.</p>
            <p>Possessions can become part of our identity. This is akin to the beliefs of those before us who buried
              the deceased with their goods. These items were important to the departed, yet not important enough for
              the living to keep.</p>

            <p>Ah, statistics and data science, where the numbers never lie, but oh, how the liars figure! It's a world
              where you can twist and turn the data until it confesses to whatever narrative you desire, all while
              maintaining a facade of objectivity.</p>
            <p>As Mark Twain so aptly put it, "Figures don't lie, but liars figure."</p>
            <p>And boy, do they figure!</p>
            <p>They massage those datasets until they scream for mercy, cherry-picking variables and massaging
              coefficients until they sing in perfect harmony with the desired conclusion.</p>
            <p>It's a game of manipulation masked in the guise of science, where correlation is mistaken for causation,
              and outliers are either heroes or villains, depending on the story you want to tell.</p>
            <p>So, let's raise our hands in applause to the statistical illusionists, the masters of deception in a
              world where truth is but a malleable commodity, and where the only thing certain is the uncertainty
              lurking behind every regression line.</p>
            <p>In this era of relentless data obsession, where every decision is made under the oppressive gaze of
              analytics dashboards and pie charts, it seems we've traded common sense for the seductive allure of
              data-driven delusion, where the quest for numbers reigns supreme, even if it means sacrificing our sanity
              at the altar of statistical significance.</p>
